# StudyBuddy

## Inspiration  
We noticed that many students struggle to balance their homework, extracurricular activities, and personal time, leading to stress and burnout. Our inspiration was to create a tool that simplifies academic management, helping students stay organized and motivated while achieving their goals. As students ourselves, we wanted to build a solution that would work seamlessly for our own busy schedules.

## What It Does  
StudyBuddy is a personalized homework and study organizer that helps students:  
- **Track assignments and deadlines.**  
- **Generate optimized study schedules** based on priority and due dates.  
- **Stay on top of tasks** with reminders and visual progress tracking.  
- **Focus better** with a built-in Pomodoro timer for efficient study sessions.  

It’s designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and easy for students to integrate into their daily routines.

## How We Built It  
We built StudyBuddy using the following tools and technologies:  
- **Backend**: Flask to handle routing, scheduling logic, and task management.  
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user data (assignments, deadlines, progress).  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean and responsive user interface. We used Bootstrap to speed up the design process.  
- **Algorithms**: Python's Pandas library to organize and prioritize assignments dynamically.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Heroku for easy accessibility.  

We followed an agile approach, breaking the project into smaller milestones like user authentication, database setup, scheduling logic, and UI design.

## Challenges We Ran Into  
1. **Dynamic Scheduling Logic**: Balancing assignment priorities, deadlines, and available time was tricky to code in a way that feels natural for users.  
2. **UI Responsiveness**: Making the design intuitive and visually clear across devices required extra attention to detail.  
3. **Time Management**: Limited time during the hackathon meant we had to prioritize features and leave some optional ideas for later development.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of  
- Successfully implementing a dynamic scheduling system that adapts to user inputs and prioritizes tasks effectively.  
- Creating a visually appealing and functional UI within the hackathon time frame.  
- Building a tool that could genuinely help students like us organize their work and reduce stress.

## What We Learned  
- **Technical Skills**: Improved our knowledge of Flask, databases, and scheduling algorithms.  
- **Teamwork**: Learned how to collaborate effectively under pressure and divide tasks based on individual strengths.  
- **User-Centric Design**: Realized the importance of making the app intuitive and addressing real-world problems faced by students.

## What’s Next for StudyBuddy  
1. **Mobile App Version**: Extend StudyBuddy into a mobile app for even greater accessibility.  
2. **Advanced Scheduling Features**:  
   - Use AI to optimize schedules dynamically based on past user behavior.  
   - Add natural language input for creating tasks (e.g., “Add math homework due Friday”).  
3. **Collaboration Tools**: Enable sharing schedules or assignments with classmates.  
4. **Gamification**: Implement badges, streaks, and rewards for completing tasks on time to motivate users.
